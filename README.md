# nm_myzoom_project


This project implements a feedback validation system for educational technology (EdTech) platforms using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. It leverages a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to classify whether user feedback text aligns with the given reason for the feedback.

Workflow:

Preprocess and augment the feedback dataset.

Fine-tune a BERT model for classification.

Evaluate model performance with metrics and confusion matrix.

Deploy a Gradio web app for real-time feedback validation.
